# 42-Swity-Companion

The aim of the project is to build an application that will retrieve the information of 42 student, using the 42 API. An **API** (**A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. APIs often come in the form of a library that includes specifications for routines, data structures, object classes, and variables. In other cases, notably **SOAP** and **REST** services, an API is simply a specification of remote calls exposed to the API consumers.
